  "caveats": "wine-stable supports both 32-bit and 64-bit. It is compatible with an existing\n32-bit wine prefix, but it will now default to 64-bit when you create a new\nwine prefix. The architecture can be selected using the WINEARCH environment\nvariable which can be set to either win32 or win64.\n\nTo create a new pure 32-bit prefix, you can run:\n  $ WINEARCH=win32 WINEPREFIX=~/.wine32 winecfg\n\nSee the Wine FAQ for details: https://wiki.winehq.org/FAQ#Wineprefixes\n",
